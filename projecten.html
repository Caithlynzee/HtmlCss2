     <h2>Ortec</h2>
     <p>
       We went with the class to Zoetermeer, for Ortec.
     </p>
     <p>
       We got the assignment to make 4 graphs and 1 heatmap.
     </p>
     <p>
       The graphs and heat map were about the bicycle thefts in Rotterdam.
     </p>
     <p>
       We worked in a group, becase than it was a little bit easier.

     <h2>Milky-monsters</h2>
     <p>
      The milky monster was a small project of 2 hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      We take of an empty pack of milk that can be closed and opend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Further we used a motor and a microbit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The engine could open and close the mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The motor was controlled by the microbit, by means of light and shadow.
